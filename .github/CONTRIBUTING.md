## How to contribute to Kenku FM

For our own wellbeing Kenku FM follows a similar contribution policy projects like [Litestream](https://github.com/benbjohnson/litestream#open-source-not-open-contribution).

This means we are open to pull requests for bug fixes only. Pull requests for new features will not be accepted due to the burden of maintaining these features into the future.


#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/owlbear-rodeo/kenku-fm/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/owlbear-rodeo/kenku-fm/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.


#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.


#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability will generally not be accepted


#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

Pull requests for new features will not be accepted due to the burden of maintaining these features into the future. Only bug fixes are accepted for contribution at this time.
